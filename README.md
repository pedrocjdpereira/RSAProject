Project Repository: Redes e Sistemas Aut√≥nomos Class

Libraries are critical resources within academic environments, providing students the necessary tools for study and research. However, the occupancy levels during peak hours or during exam times can lead to overcrowding. By implementing a real-time occupancy tracking system, the allocations of library spaces could be optimized and it would reduce significantly the process and noise of searching for a free spot. 

Therefore, the objective of this project is to track the occupancy of the University of Aveiro's library, more precisely the exact occupancy of every table, and display that information in real time on a dashboard.
